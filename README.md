a. The Birth of Software Engineering (1960s) & The Software Crisis
What Happened?
Software development was facing issues such as missed deadlines,cost overruns and software failure due to computers becoming more powerful
Why It Mattered?
The crisis led to the first NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968), where the term "software engineering" was formally introduced.

b. The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)(1970s–1980s)
What Happened?
Object-Oriented Programming emerged as a response to the increasing complexity of software systems. OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for more modular and reusable code.
Why It Mattered?
These paradigms improved software development by enhancing code readability, reusability, and maintainability. OOP, popularized by languages like C++ and later Java, became the foundation for modern software systems.

c. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (Early 2000s)
What Happened?
The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced an iterative, collaborative approach to software development, moving away from rigid, document-heavy processes.
DevOps (2010s) emerged to integrate software development and IT operations, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery through automation and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD).
Why It Mattered?
Agile methodologies enabled teams to deliver software faster and adapt to changing requirements, while DevOps improved efficiency, scalability, and deployment speed in software engineering.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning-the  project’s objectives, scope, and feasibility are defined.Ensures the project is viable and aligns with business goals before development starts.
2. Requirements Gathering & Analysis-collection and documentation of functional and non-functional requirements is done.There is also  communication with stakeholders to understand user needs. understand user needs.This helps ensure software meets user expectations and prevent misunderstandings.
3. Design- high-level architecture (software structure, technology stack) are decided.eg design of UI/UX, database models.This provides a clear blueprint for developers, reducing errors during development.
4. Development (Coding)-code is written and implemented usign programming languages,frameworks and tools.It is the phase where the idea is turned to real software.
5. Testing-This involves identifying and fixing of bugs in the software.This is done through  unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).This is key in ensuring the software is functional, secure, and bug-free before release.
6. Deployment0this is simply making the software available to the users.The software is deployed to production or a live environment.
7. Maintenance & Support-This involves monitoring and ficing bugs,release uodates/additional features can be added.This helps in ensuring stability, security, and usability of the software.
   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase (such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next.On the other side Agile is an iterative, flexible approach that divides the project into small, manageable increments called sprints. 
While Waterfall ensures structured documentation and a clear project timeline, Agile promotes collaboration, rapid development, and frequent testing.
Waterfall: Best for Structured & Predictable Projects
✅ Example: Developing a Banking System
In banking software, security and compliance requirements are well-defined from the start.
Changes after implementation can be costly.
Agile: Best for Evolving & Fast-Changing Projects
✅ Example: Mobile App Development
User feedback is constantly collected, leading to frequent updates and improvements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.It typically includes a code editor, debugger, build automation tools, and sometimes version control integration.
Importance of IDEs in Software Development:
Increased Productivity: IDEs integrate multiple tools such as code editors, compilers, interpreters, and debuggers into a single interface. This integration reduces the time spent on setting up and managing separate tools, allowing developers to focus more on coding and problem-solving.By automating tasks and providing real-time feedback, IDEs enhance developer productivity and efficiency.

Improved Code Quality: IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and refactoring tools. These features help reduce syntax errors and improve code readability and maintainability. Better code quality leads to fewer bugs and easier maintenance, which are critical for delivering reliable software.

Simplified Development Process:IDEs provide a unified environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. This simplifies the development process by allowing developers to perform all these tasks within a single application.Simplification of the development process reduces complexity and makes it easier for developers to manage projects efficiently.
Examples of Popular IDEs:Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ,JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA,Eclipse ,PyCharm 


Version Control Systems (VCS)-helps developers manage changes in source code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate, track modifications, and revert to previous versions when needed.
Importance of VCS in Software Development:
Facilitates Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes.
Tracks Code History – Developers can view the history of code changes, making it easy to identify who made a change and why.
Enables Code Backup & Recovery – Prevents loss of work by storing previous versions of the project, making it easy to revert to a stable version if something goes wrong.
Enhances Code Deployment – Many VCS platforms integrate with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines to automate software testing and deployment.
Examples of Popular VCS:
Git – The most widely used VCS, enabling distributed version control. Works locally and with remote repositories like GitHub.
GitHub – A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories and enabling collaboration.
GitLab – Similar to GitHub but offers built-in CI/CD pipelines.
Bitbucket – A VCS platform with strong integration for teams using Jira and other Atlassian tools.
Apache Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system used in some enterprise environments.
